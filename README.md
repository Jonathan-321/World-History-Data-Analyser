# World-History-Data-Analyser
This program that enables a user to perform actions on world history data contained in a binary file 'worldHistory.dat'. 
The data file contains information about major events and world population for the years 1950 to 2020. 
I was able to learn more about reading and writing inside a binary file. 
I hope to work on some more related problems in the future >
