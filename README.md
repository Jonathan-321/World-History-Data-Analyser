# World-History-Data-Analyser
This program that enables a user to perform actions on world history data contained in a binary file 'worldHistory.dat'. 
The data file contains information about major events and world population for the years 1950 to 2020. 
The program provides the user with 4 options from a menu: Show Year, Show Population Range, Change Record, and Show World Events. 
The program also terminates and saves data when the user selects the Exit option.

I was able to learn more about reading and writing inside a binary file. 
I hope to work on some more related problems in the future as well>
